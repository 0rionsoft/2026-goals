## 🔥 How to maximise time off
- [ ] Book the “bridge” days first (the 4-day blocks above)
- [ ] Keep the first 24 hours of leave low-stimulation (sleep, walk, good food)
- [ ] Use micro-add-ons (half-day Friday + weekend) for extra mileage
- [ ] Match breaks to seasons (Apr–Sep for daylight trips; Oct–Mar for cosy/project time)
- [ ] Add one 90-minute life-admin slot mid-break to avoid post-holiday chaos

## 🏴 Scotland / Northern Ireland note
- [ ] If I’m in Scotland or Northern Ireland, re-check the local bank holidays and re-calc the best “bridge” weeks
